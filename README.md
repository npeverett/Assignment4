This program is a library/office registrar that implements a doubly-linked list queue to store students and uses an array
as office windows. When a window is ready, the student is transferred from the queue into the window, until there are no longer
any students waiting. In addition, the summary statistics should be printed out, however there were issues with an stoi() function
not allowing mathematical operations which is explained in the "Simulation.cpp" file with commented code.
